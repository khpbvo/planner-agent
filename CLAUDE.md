# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 🚀 Quick Start for New Assistants

### Essential Files to Read First
1. **Documentation**: Start with `/Docs/index.md` - OpenAI Agents SDK documentation
2. **Main Entry**: `src/main.py` - Application entry point and initialization
3. **Orchestrator**: `src/agent_modules/orchestrator.py` - Central agent coordination
4. **Models**: `src/models/context.py` - Core data models (PlanningContext, EntityContext)
5. **Tools**: `src/tools/__init__.py` - Tool factory functions
6. **Tests**: `tests/test_integration.py` - Understanding component interactions

### Key Import Pattern
```python
# CORRECT: The package is installed as 'openai-agents' but imported as 'agents'
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool, SQLiteSession
# NOT: from openai_agents import ...
```

## Project Overview

The system features a sophisticated multi-agent architecture with intelligent handoffs, advanced NLP context management, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

### ✅ Current Status: ADVANCED IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The project now includes:
- **Multi-Agent Intelligence**: Sophisticated agent coordination with intelligent handoffs
- **Advanced NLP**: Context-aware processing with entity coreference resolution
- **Complete API Integrations**: Full OAuth flows and CRUD operations for all services
- **Smart Planning**: Optimal scheduling with workload analysis and conflict resolution
- **Production Monitoring**: Real-time tracing, dashboards, and performance analytics
- **Safety & Security**: Input/output guardrails and comprehensive error handling

### 🔧 Recent Debugging & Fixes (December 2024)

#### Integration Issues Resolved
1. **Import Corrections**: Confirmed `from agents import` is correct (not `openai_agents`)
2. **Model Attribute Fixes**: 
   - `PlanningContext.entities` → `PlanningContext.entity_context`

## Architecture

### Advanced Multi-Agent Pattern
Uses sophisticated "agents-as-tools" pattern with intelligent handoffs:

**Orchestrator Agent** (main) coordinates specialized agents with context-aware delegation:
- **Language Processor Agent**: Advanced NLP with context management, entity coreference resolution, temporal parsing
- **Calendar Manager Agent**: MacOS Calendar integration with conflict detection and availability optimization
- **Task Manager Agent**: Complete Todoist integration with project management, labels, and priorities
- **Email Processor Agent**: Gmail OAuth with action item extraction and smart categorization
- **Smart Planner Agent**: Intelligent scheduling with workload analysis and optimal time slot finding

**Handoff System**: Intelligent delegation based on request complexity, urgency, and context.
**Context Management**: Multi-turn conversation tracking with entity resolution and reference handling.
**Monitoring System**: Real-time tracing, performance metrics, and interactive dashboards.

### Key Components

## SDK Implementation Details

### Correct Imports
```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool, SQLiteSession  # Note: NOT openai_agents
from openai.types.responses import ResponseTextDeltaEvent
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Import Names**: Always use `from agents import`, not `from openai_agents import`
2. **Tool Invocation**: Tools are FunctionTool objects - use `tool.on_invoke_tool(ctx, args)` not `tool(args)`
3. **Model Attributes**: Check exact attribute names in models (e.g., `entity_context` not `entities`)
4. **Context Passing**: Always use `RunContextWrapper` when invoking tools manually

### Agent Creation Pattern
```python
# Create tool first
@function_tool
async def my_tool(input_data: MyModel) -> str:
    # Tool implementation
    return result

# Create agent with tools
agent = Agent(
    name="Agent Name",
    instructions="Agent instructions",
    tools=[my_tool],
    model="gpt-4o"
)

# Use agent as tool in orchestrator
orchestrator = Agent(
    name="Orchestrator",
    instructions="Orchestrator instructions",
    tools=[
        agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="my_agent",
            tool_description="What this agent does"
        )
    ]
)
```

### Session Usage
```python
# Create session
session = SQLiteSession(
    session_id="conversation_id",
    db_path="data/conversations.db"
)

# Use with Runner
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    message,
    session=session,
    max_turns=10
)
```

### Streaming Implementation
```python
# Streaming runner
result = Runner.run_streamed(agent, message, session=session)

# Process stream events
async for event in result.stream_events():
    if event.type == "raw_response_event":
        if isinstance(event.data, ResponseTextDeltaEvent):
            # Handle token delta
            text += event.data.delta
    elif event.type == "run_item_stream_event":
        # Handle tool calls, completions
        pass
    elif event.type == "agent_updated_stream_event":
        # Handle agent handoffs
        pass
```

## Testing Approach

### Quick Verification
```bash
# 1. Run the test suite
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# 2. Test application startup
python test_main_app.py

# 3. Run the actual application
python src/main.py
```

### Basic Functionality Testing
Run the CLI and test with natural language:
- "What's on my calendar today?"
- "Add a task to review the report by Friday"  
- "Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 2pm"
- "Check my emails and create tasks for important items"

### Debugging Integration Issues
When debugging agent/tool integration:
1. Check imports are from `agents` not `openai_agents`
2. Verify tool creation returns `FunctionTool` objects
3. Check model attribute names match exactly
4. Review trace files in `src/data/traces/` for error details
5. Run integration tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_integration.py -v`

### Advanced Feature Testing
Test sophisticated capabilities:
- "Analyze my workload for next week and suggest optimizations"
- "Move that meeting to Friday" (tests coreference resolution)
- "Schedule time to prepare for it" (tests pronoun resolution)
- "Organize my tasks by priority and reschedule conflicting items"
- "Extract action items from my recent emails and add them to my project"

### Monitoring and Analytics
- Use `/monitor` to open the real-time dashboard
- Use `/analytics` to view comprehensive system metrics
- Use `/handoffs` to analyze agent coordination patterns
- Monitor streaming interface for handoff visualizations

### Demo Scripts
Run comprehensive demonstrations:
```bash
python examples/handoff_demo.py          # Multi-agent coordination
python examples/nlp_context_demo.py      # Advanced context management  
python examples/monitoring_demo.py       # System monitoring
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Import Errors
```python
# ❌ WRONG: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openai_agents'
from openai_agents import Agent

# ✅ CORRECT: The package installs as 'openai-agents' but imports as 'agents'
from agents import Agent
```

### Tool Invocation Errors
```python
# ❌ WRONG: TypeError: 'FunctionTool' object is not callable
result = await my_tool(args)

# ✅ CORRECT: Use the on_invoke_tool method
from agents import RunContextWrapper
ctx = RunContextWrapper(context=None)
result = await my_tool.on_invoke_tool(ctx, json.dumps(args))
```

### Model Attribute Errors
```python
# ❌ WRONG: AttributeError: 'PlanningContext' object has no attribute 'entities'
context.entities

# ✅ CORRECT: Use the actual attribute name
context.entity_context
```

### Calendar Access
macOS requires calendar permissions. Grant in:
System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Calendar

### SpaCy Model Not Found
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

### Agent Tool Assignment
Tools must be assigned during Agent creation, not after:
```python
# Correct
agent = Agent(name="Agent", tools=[tool1, tool2])

# Incorrect
agent = Agent(name="Agent")
agent.tools = [tool1, tool2]  # This doesn't work
```

### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Install additional dependencies for advanced features
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client
pip install todoist-api-python
pip install rich prompt-toolkit
```
