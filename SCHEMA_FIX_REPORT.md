# PlannerAgent Schema Fix - Summary Report

## Issues Identified from Log Files

Based on the `planner.log` and trace files, the following critical issues were found:

### 1. OpenAI Function Schema Validation Errors
**Error Message:**
```
Invalid schema for function 'manage_calendar': In context=('properties', 'event_data', 'anyOf', '0'), schema must have a 'type' key.
```

Similar errors occurred for:
- `manage_calendar` (calendar_tool.py)
- `manage_emails` (gmail_tool.py) 
- `manage_tasks` (todoist_tool.py)

**Root Cause:**
The openai-agents package was generating invalid OpenAI function schemas when Pydantic models contained `Optional[Any]` fields. The generated schemas had `anyOf` arrays without proper `type` definitions, which OpenAI's API rejected.

### 2. Integration Access Failures
The application was failing to connect to various services (Gmail, Todoist, Calendar), partially due to the schema validation preventing the tools from being registered properly.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated todoist_tool.py
- **Added imports:** Added `Field` import from pydantic
- **Created strict model:** Replaced `Optional[Any]` with a concrete `TaskDataPayload` model
- **Fixed response types:** Changed `List[Any]` to `List[Dict[str, str]]` to avoid schema issues

```python
class TaskDataPayload(BaseModel):
    """Strict schema for task data to avoid anyOf issues"""
    content: str = Field(..., description="Task content/title")
    description: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Task description")
    due_datetime: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Due date in ISO format")
    priority: int = Field(1, description="Priority 1-4")
    labels: Optional[List[str]] = Field(None, description="Task labels")
    project_id: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Project ID")
```

### 2. Updated calendar_tool.py models
- **Fixed CalendarOperation:** Changed `Optional[str]` to `str` with default for calendar_name
- **Fixed CalendarResponse:** Changed `List[Any]` to `List[Dict[str, str]]` for all list fields

### 3. Gmail tool was already fixed
The gmail_tool.py already had the correct pattern with `EmailPayload` model, which served as the template for the other fixes.

## Verification

Created test scripts to verify the fixes:
1. **test_schema_fix.py** - Validates that all tools can be created without schema errors
2. **test_orchestrator.py** - Verifies the orchestrator agent initializes with all tools

Both tests pass successfully:
```
✅ All tools passed schema validation!
✅ Orchestrator agent is ready with all fixed tools!
```

## Key Lessons

1. **Avoid `Any` type in Pydantic models** when generating OpenAI function schemas
2. **Use concrete models** instead of `Optional[Any]` for complex data structures
3. **Specify explicit types** for all fields, even in generic containers like Lists
4. **Test schema generation** separately from runtime functionality

## Next Steps

1. Run the main application to verify integrations work properly
2. Consider updating the openai-agents package to handle schema generation better
3. Add unit tests for schema validation to prevent regression

## Files Modified

- `/src/tools/todoist_tool.py` - Fixed schema issues
- `/src/models/calendar_tool.py` - Fixed response model types
- Created test files for validation

The application should now start without the schema validation errors that were preventing the tools from registering with the OpenAI API.
